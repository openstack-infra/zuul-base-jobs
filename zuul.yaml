      The recommended base job.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.

      It also sets a default timeout value (which may be overidden).

    name: base-test

      main job in production.  Not for general use.
